# Recursive Factorial Analysis
In this analysis, is going to be compared the ***traditional recursive factorial method (Method A)*** and an ***alternative recursive version using a dictionary (Method B)***. Efficency and dictionary size are going to be analyzed.

How this analysis is estructured:
   1. Time spent between both methods.
   2. Time difference depending on the distribution of numbers inside the list:
        - Ascendent sort.
        - Descendent sort.
        - Random sort.
